# MCFunction-Canner
loops and code blocks, yet still parses unchanged .mcfunction scripts

## Usage
Place `canner.py` inside your minecraft directory and execute it with [python >=3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/). It will "can" `.mccanner` scripts down into `.mcfunction` form, then scan for changes every .5s in the background.
