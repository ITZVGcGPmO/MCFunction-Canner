# MCFunction-Canner
loops and code blocks, yet still parses unchanged .mcfunction scripts

![](https://github.com/ITZVGcGPmO/MCFunction-Canner/raw/pageresources/im1.png)

## Usage
Place `canner.py` inside your minecraft directory and execute it with [python >=3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/). It will "can" `.mccanner` scripts down into `.mcfunction` form, then scan for changes every .5s in the background.

you may change existing `.mcfunction` scripts to `.mccanner`, and they will be parsed correctly

## Warning
This tool has only been tested with 1.13 command syntax. supposidly a "downgrade" tool will be in the works.
